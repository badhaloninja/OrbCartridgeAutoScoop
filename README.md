A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/). Makes MaterialTip grab a new material regardless if there is already a material orb in the tool

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [MaterialTipAutoScoop.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/MaterialTipAutoScoop/releases/latest/download/MaterialTipAutoScoop.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
